# Run main_app.py

# How it works?
# On the homepage (StatementsPage), transaction details can be added for any customer or dealer. For Customers, while adding the transaction, the total amount of transaction should be entered in the Debit side and the amount received should be entered in Credit side. For Dealers, the fields are reverse. (It might not seem as the accounting terms maynot match here.)

# The details of Customers and Dealers can be added from corresponding buttons. The transactions, receivables and payables of specific person can be seen there as well.
# On Stocks page, the stocked products along with their respective amount are shown. The stocks can be reduced and deleted.
# On the Purchases page, the invoice detail of purchases can be added. This will add the stocks as well.
# On the Sales page, the invoice for sales can be created. If there is insufficient quantity, it will raise error for that product and remove it from the invoice detail.

Most of the features can be explored on our own. However, if anyone need further help, please contact me.
